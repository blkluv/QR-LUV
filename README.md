## Inspiration
The most famous game that gives detective vibes and can play together with friends is..... You guessed it right "Treasure hunt".
So why not add some tech to the old school treasure hunt game and move it a step further. That's what our project QR Hunt does.
QR Hunt revamps the traditional treasure hunt game by adding 'QR' in combination with clues. 
The game contains two mobile apps one for the organizer, basically the one who is gonna conduct the game. And the other app will be for the players, "who is gonna participate in the treasure hunt".

## What it does

The game goes like this, 
The organizer develops a few clues, hints, questions whatever you call it which on solving will point to a location in a community or a park where the game is gonna take place. An example for one such location can be a post box, or a slide inside a park, etc..
So after coming up with the clues for as many locations as possible each location is arranged with a two-digit code. This code can be used in the organizer's app to generate a QR which needs to be placed at that location. So in a similar fashion, QRs are generated corresponding to each location and pasted.

Once everything is done, it's time to call participants. Each participant can play alone or can pair up with their friends to form a team.
All the participants should install the player App. Each team is given a 'login QR' which can be generated by the organizer using 'organizers app' by entering the combination of location codes. After every team gets the 'login QR' the hunt begins. 

- Each team needs to scan the login QR to get the clues revealed.
- Participants needs to solve those clues 
- and reach the location corresponding to that particular clue and scan the QR at that location to verify the solutions.
The team which solves all the clues and comes back to origin first will be declared as the winner of the Hunt.
